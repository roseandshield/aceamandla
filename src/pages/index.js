                <p>

                  technical and professional skills that are broadly applicable
                  across sectors. Our students embody this professional skill
                  set with their clear communication, ability to collaborate,
                  attention to detail, research and strategic planning, and
                  critical problem solving that will ensure their success in an
                  ever-changing economy.
